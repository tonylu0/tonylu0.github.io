This tutorial allows you to utilize VastAI, a cloud gpu rental service,
to run FastAI, a great AI kickstarter library. While services like Paperspace
and other cloud GPU providers can provide introductory GPUs, a problem arises
when more compute is needed. Utilizing powerful hardware on popular cloud providers
can prove to be expensive. Therefore, VastAI provides a solution by allowing consumers
to rent out their personal GPUs to be used, resulting in a decrease in price.

To get started, to go the [VastAI website](https://vast.ai/) and create an account.
